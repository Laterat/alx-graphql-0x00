# Episode Queries - GraphQL Practice

This directory contains GraphQL queries and output results for retrieving the details of specific episodes using the `episode(id: ID!)` field from the Rick and Morty GraphQL API.

## ✅ Objective

Write a GraphQL query to fetch the details of a specific episode using its ID.

## 🧾 Fields Retrieved

Each episode query retrieves the following fields:

- `id`
- `name`
- `air_date`
- `episode`

## Files

- `episode-page-1.graphql` & `characters-page-1-output.json`
- `characters-page-2.graphql` & `characters-page-2-output.json`
- `characters-page-3.graphql` & `characters-page-3-output.json`
- `characters-page-4.graphql` & `characters-page-4-output.json`

You can replicate the same structure for additional episodes by changing the ID in the query.

## 🌐 API Reference

All queries were tested using the [Rick and Morty GraphQL API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql).
