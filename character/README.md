# Character Queries - GraphQL Practice

This directory contains GraphQL queries and output results for retrieving character information using the `character(id: ID!)` query.

## Files

Each GraphQL query retrieves the following fields:

- id
- name
- status
- species
- type
- gender

## Query Files and Outputs

- `character-id-1.graphql` & `character-id-1-output.json`
- `character-id-2.graphql` & `character-id-2-output.json`
- `character-id-3.graphql` & `character-id-3-output.json`
- `character-id-4.graphql` & `character-id-4-output.json`

These queries use IDs 1 through 4 respectively.
